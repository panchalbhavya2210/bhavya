        Hello, I Am Bhavya. I am a 22-year-old front-end website developer from
        India. And I am learning the backend. Currently, I am in college, doing
        the 5th semester of the BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) Course at
        Monark University. I started programming as a hobby. I got into
        programming in lockdown and started learning it from the Mimo app and
        various YouTube channels. <br />
        Beside working part-time at a pharmacy and doing college, I created some
        side projects that gave me a lot of experience. And I am also eager to learn
        new things. I have learned a lot from practicals.
        <br /><br />
        Coding Journey, <br /> I started learning front-end website development
        in 2020. I did most of the learning from the Mimo App and YouTube
        Videos. After learning the basics, I got into creating various projects.
        I created some basic projects and improved them over time. I started
        coding on my phone, and I created various projects using the SPCK
        editor. <br /> After coding in mobile for a long time. I bought a laptop
        and started coding on it. I mostly use Visual Studio Code for programming.
        I am still learning the basics of the backend so I can become a full-stack
        developer.
